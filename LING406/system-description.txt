I decide to use | to captures basic weekdays and holidays. However, my program would only capture weekdays if they are followed by a period or dot. For example, it will capture "Monday" in 'on Monday, imperiling a vast stretch'. I design the system in this fashion to avoid capture duplicate weekdays (capture "Wednesday" in 'Wednesday, Oct. 11th').  To capture examples such as "Monday Morning", I use noncapture group ?: and | operator. To capture date format in number, I use \d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{1,4}. To capture examples such as 'Wednesday, Oct. 11th', I first use non-capture group ?: | operator to specify weekday; then I use another non-capture group ?: and  | to specify month; I use the third non-capture group to match date and suffix such as "th/st/nd/rd". To capture examples such as 'The 21st of September', I use the non-capture group to capture the "th/st/nd/rd" part. I also use the similar regex structure to capture examples such as 'Monday the 23rd'.
